# Chat Sounds

Plays a sound whenever a chat message is received.

The sound is different for join messages, leave messages, deaths, and private messages.
You can select which vanilla sound you want to play for these events, and adjust their volume and pitch.

This mod requires [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), the [Fabric API](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), and [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config).
Also, it conflicts with ReplayMod.
